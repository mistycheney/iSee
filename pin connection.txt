Mega <-> WiFi shield

MEGA pin 50 (MISO) to WiFi Shield pin 12.
MEGA pin 51 (MOSI) to  WiFi Shield pin 11.
MEGA pin 52 (SCK) to  WiFi Shield pin 13.
MEGA pin 53 (SS) to  WiFi Shield pin 10.

Mega pin 19 to WiFiShield pin 2 (Wifi shield interrupt)

Mega <-> Uno:

Mega pin 20 to Uno pin A4 (SDA)
Mega pin 21 to Uno pin A5 (SCL)

Uno <-> Motor board

Uno pin 0,1 are for uploading programs using serial cable, so should not connect.
Uno pin A4,A5 reserved for I2C.
RuggedCircuits motor board uses 3(PWM1), 12(DIR1), 11(PWM2), 13(DIR2)
Empirically, pin 9 can not be used as digital pin, only use as PWM.
